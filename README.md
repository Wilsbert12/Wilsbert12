# Hi there, I'm Wilsbert 👋

## 🚀 Career Changer | SaaS Sales → Data Science & MLOps

After 6.5+ years in SaaS sales at companies like **Salesforce**, I've made a strategic pivot into Data Science and Machine Learning Operations. My journey from zero coding experience to deploying production ML systems has been challenging but incredibly rewarding!

## 🎓 Recent Achievement
**6-Month Intensive Data Science & MLOps Bootcamp**  
*Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne* | 300+ hours of hands-on training

From writing my first Python script to building complete MLOps pipelines - this transformation represents months of dedication and countless hours of coding, debugging, and learning.
